# Project: Physics Solver with Fluid Mechanics Simulation and Fire Simulation

## Introduction
This project provides an implementation of a physics solver featuring simulations of fluid mechanics and fire. 

## Dependencies
Before running the simulation, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Python 3

## Execution Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `make` command to compile the code.
4. Launch the simulation using the command `python3 particle_gui.py`.
5. Press the 'e' key to initiate the simulation.

## Notes

- The fluid mechanics and fire simulations may take some time to load, depending on the power of your hardware.
- Ensure you have the necessary execution rights for the Python script (`chmod +x particle_gui.py`).
- If encountering execution issues, verify that the required dependencies are correctly installed.

## Contribution
Contributions in the form of bug fixes, feature enhancements, or suggestions are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on the repository.
